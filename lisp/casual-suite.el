;;; Commentary:

;; An umbrella package to support a single installation point for all Casual
;; porcelains. Included are porcelains for the following packages:

;; - Calc (casual)
;; - I-Search (cc-isearch-menu)
;; - Dired (casual-dired)
;; - Avy (casual-avy)
;; - Info (casual-info)

;; INSTALLATION

;; As this is an umbrella package, it is highly recommended that a deep reading
;; of the install procedure for each porcelain be done beforehand as each of
;; them have their own recommended customizations to go alongside them.
;; https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-suite

;; The following code is a TL;DR initialization for Casual Suite.
;; (require 'casual-suite)
;; (define-key calc-mode-map (kbd "C-o") #'casual-calc-tmenu)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-o") #'casual-dired-tmenu)
;; (define-key info-mode-map (kbd "C-o") #'casual-info-tmenu)
;; (keymap-global-set "M-g" #'casual-avy-tmenu)
;; (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "<f2>") 'cc-isearch-menu-transient)
