;;; Commentary:

;; An umbrella package to support a single installation point for all Casual
;; user interfaces. Included are user interfaces for the following packages:

;; - Bookmarks (casual-bookmarks)
;; - Calc (casual-calc)
;; - Dired (casual-dired)
;; - I-Search (casual-isearch)
;; - IBuffer (casual-ibuffer)
;; - Info (casual-info)
;; - RE-Builder (casual-re-builder)
;; - Org Agenda (casual-agenda)
;; - Avy (casual-avy)
;; - Symbol Overlay (casual-symbol-overlay)
;; - EditKit (casual-editkit)

;; INSTALLATION

;; As this is an umbrella package, it is highly recommended that a deep reading
;; of the install procedure for each user interface be done beforehand as each of
;; them have their own recommended customizations to go alongside them.
;; https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-suite

;; The following code is a TL;DR initialization for Casual Suite.

;; NOTE: This package requires `casual-lib' which in turn requires an update of
;; the built-in package `transient' â‰¥ 0.6.0. Please customize the variable
;; `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to t to allow for `transient' to be
;; updated. For further details, consult the INSTALL section of this package's
;; README.
